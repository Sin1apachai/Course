## Create a condition using if else. The conditions are as follows.
## Let a and b be equal to 10 and 20, respectively. If a is equal to b, then "a=b" is expressed, and if a is equal to b * 2, then "a is equal to b*2". 
## Finally, if none of the conditions are met, it will be shown that "Nothing is correct."
